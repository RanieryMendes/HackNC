I hate all of the arrogant assholes here. Everyone is so fucking pretentious.
How people can manage to argue about absolutely nothing for hours on end blows my mind. Today this bitch in my lecture class kept talking about how awful her roommate is; how annoying she is and how she always tries to insert herself into activities. 
Absolutely terrible comments about this poor girl who wasn’t there to defend herself.
And then, the roommate walks into the lecture late and the girl pretends as if the previous conversation never happened. She talks with her roommate about the lecture and invites her to plans later as if she didn’t mention how irritating it was that her roommate follows her around everywhere. 
I wanted to mention to the roommate how she was betrayed thirty seconds before she walked through the door, but then the professor came in and I had to focus on the class. Maybe it’s none of my business anyway, but those bitches really got under my skin.
