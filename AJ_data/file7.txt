Graduation is the day every college student waits for. It is the day when you know that all of the exams and the late nights of studying have been worth it. The day you realize that everything you have accomplished has all been reaching the peak of this moment. I admired the way our professors smiled at us as we walked across the stage, and the way they seemed proud of us for our growth from freshman year. 

I loved hearing the applause from the crowd of parents and the way groups of families were celebrating as each individual’s name was announced. The cheerfulness present in my family’s eyes as I walked across the stage was a moment that I would cherish forever. When the ceremony was over, I hugged my dearest friends and wished them luck on their individual journeys. This part of college is something I will never forget, but the next part is what I look forward to the most.
