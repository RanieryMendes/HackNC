Today was a pretty boring day of attending classes. I went to my lectures, ate lunch in the dining hall, and then came to the gym to work out. Then, at 2:00 PM I saw my old roommate from freshman year! Seeing her completely brightened my day. We chatted for a while about the school year, our plans for the upcoming semester, and what we were going to do over winter break. 

I had to leave early so that I could go to my mentorship meeting, but it was nice to see my old roommate, even if it was for a brief moment. We made plans to grab lunch next week, which I am looking forward to.
