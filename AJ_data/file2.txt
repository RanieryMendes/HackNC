Another chemistry test ended in a defeat today. 
Despite how much I study, I just cannot seem to retain the information from lectures. 
I always dread getting my tests back and seeing scores much lower than I am used to. I wonder how a person who used to get straight A's could get to the point where a 70 was a miracle. 
My professor passed the exam back and told me that she expected better from me. Somehow, this was worse than if she just handed me back an exam with a zero and said nothing.

My chest ached with every red mark on my exam. I shoved the test into the bottom of my bookbag while my professor continued to discuss the breakdown of the exam results. 
I almost ran out of the lecture hall so I could antagonize myself alone in my room. I told myself that there would be other exams and I would do better in the future, but it was hard to believe such a thing in the here and now. 
I donâ€™t know, maybe I just need sleep.
