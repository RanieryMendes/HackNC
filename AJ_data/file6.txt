My sister brought my dog to school today. I hadnâ€™t seen her in a while, and it was so cute to see how affectionately she licked my arms and cheeks. I treated my dog and my sister to a casual lunch off-campus, and we ate some good food in the comfort of a nearby park. 

My dog was super cute and wanted to play with my sister and me the entire time. Eventually, we got tired and then my dog turned her attention to the other pets in the park and began to play with them, giving my sister and me a chance to catch up. She gave me updates from home about my cousins, and then we talked about her work and how she is moving away for school soon. I am excited for the next phase of her life, and I hope to visit her often in the future.
